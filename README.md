## 📅 Week 5 – Advanced OOPs Scenarios, Exception Handling & DSA Problems

**[12-16 January]**

---

## 12 January (Monday)

### OOPs Practice – Scenario-Based Problems

Refactored and organized 7 complex scenario-based systems into structured Java projects with proper exception handling and package organization:

- **Payment System** – Implemented a payment processing system supporting Card, UPI, and Wallet methods with custom `PaymentFailedException`.
- **Course Registration** – Created a student enrollment system with course logic and `CourseLimitExceededException`.
- **Inventory Management** – Built an inventory tracking system with stock updates, low stock alerts, and `OutOfStockException`.
- **Online Exam** – Developed an exam system with objective/descriptive evaluation strategies and `ExamTimeExpiredException`.
- **Hotel Room Booking** – Implemented a room pricing system with Deluxe/Standard rooms and `RoomNotAvailableException` using Strategy pattern.
- **Election System** – Designed a voting system with candidate tracking and `DuplicateVoteException` to prevent double voting.
- **Wallet Transfer** – Created a fund transfer system between wallets with `InsufficientBalanceException`.

### DSA Practice – Scenario-Based Problems

Solved real-world scenario-based problems applying Data Structures and Algorithms:

- **Traffic Manager** – Implemented a traffic signal simulation using a circular linked list to manage car queues efficiently.
- **Smart Shelf** – Developed a book organization system that sorts books alphabetically using Insertion Sort.
- **Ticket Sorter** – Created a ticket pricing system that sorts ticket prices using Quick Sort for optimized display.

### DSA Practice – Stacks & Queues

Solved various algorithmic problems using Stack and Queue data structures:

- **StockSpan** – Calculated the span of stock prices for all days using a stack-based approach.
- **SortStack** – Implemented a mechanism to sort elements in a stack using recursion or an auxiliary stack.
- **SlidingWindowMax** – Found the maximum element in every sliding window of size `k` using an optimized deque.
- **CircularTour** – Determined the starting petrol pump to complete a circular tour of all pumps.
- **QueueUsingStacks** – Implemented a standard queue functionality using two stacks.

### DSA Practice – HashMaps

Implemented and applied HashMaps to solve common algorithmic challenges:

- **MyHashMap** – Developed a custom HashMap implementation from scratch with collision handling.
- **ZeroSumSubarray** – Implemented logic to detect if any subarray within an array has a sum equal to zero.
- **LongestConsecutive** – Found the length of the longest subsequence of consecutive integers in an array.
- **PairSum** – Identified pairs of elements in an array that sum up to a specific target value.
- **TwoSum** – Provided an efficient solution to return indices of two numbers that add up to a target.

### DSA Practice – Sorting Algorithms

Implemented various sorting algorithms to understand different sorting techniques and their complexities:

- **BubbleSortMarks** – Implemented Bubble Sort to sort an array of marks.
- **InsertionSortIDs** – Implemented Insertion Sort to sort a list of IDs.
- **MergeSortPrices** – Implemented Merge Sort to sort product prices efficiently using divide and conquer.
- **QuickSortPrices** – Implemented Quick Sort to sort prices using partitioning.
- **SelectionSortScores** – Implemented Selection Sort to sort scores by repeatedly finding the minimum element.
- **HeapSortSalary** – Implemented Heap Sort to sort employee salaries using a binary heap.
- **CountingSortAges** – Implemented Counting Sort to sort ages efficiently for a specific range.
