This repository serves as a **learning workspace for my BridgeLabz Training**.  

It documents my **day-wise learning progress**, hands-on practice, and structured code organization.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized in a modular way.  

Currently, all foundational Core Java work resides in the **core-java-practice** directory, OOPs practice work resides in the **oops-practice** directory, and review work resides in the **review** directory.
