# BridgeLabz-Training

---

This repository serves as a **learning workspace for my BridgeLabz Training**.  

It documents my **day-wise learning progress**, hands-on practice, and structured code organization.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized in a modular way.  

Currently, all foundational Core Java work resides in the **core-java-practice** directory.
