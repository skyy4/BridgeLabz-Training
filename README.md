# BridgeLabs Training – Core Java & Git Practice

**Repository:** https://github.com/skyy4/BridgeLabs-Training  

This repository is a structured learning workspace created during my **BridgeLabs Training program**, focused on building a strong foundation in **Core Java, Git & GitHub, and logical problem-solving**.

It documents hands-on practice, well-organized Java programs, and progressive learning across fundamental and control-flow concepts while following clean coding and version-control best practices.
